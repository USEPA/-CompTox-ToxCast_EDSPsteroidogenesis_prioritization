README for Prioritization of chemicals for effects on steroidogenesis using an integrated statistical approach to high-throughput H295R data

The analysis for this manuscript was generated using an R project “mMd_follow_up.Rproj”
The paths for each R script is self-contained and may need to be changed slightly to mimic your path environment.
Folder organization is as follows:
1. scripts – contains all of the R code needed to perfom the analysis and generate all figures for the manuscript
2. RData – contains all of the RData needed to perform the analysis as well as RData files that are generated with certain R scripts
3. figures – holds the figures generated and used in the manuscript
4. supplement – all supplemental data and figures are found here
"5. misc – houses miscellaneous files and code that is not necessarily essential to the analysis (Note: simulated_data.txt is important for the simulation, this file contains data for the 10 theoretical hormone response profiles used in the large simulation study and power anlaysis.) "
6. additional_aromatase -- contains preliminary code and analysis for the aromatase inhibitors section of the manuscript (Note: tox21_putatice_aromatase_inhibitors.csv is needed for the R script Table2_compare_tox21_nvs_h295r.R to work)
